= Connecting to SQLite =

Three ways to connect to a SQLite database.

== Connection string ==
{{{SQLiteDataProvider(string connectionString);}}}

With this constructor you pass the complete SQLite connection string. You can create a new SQLite database by putting in "New=True".
{{{
provider = new SQLiteDataProvider("Data Source=" + dbPath + ";New=True");
}}}

== Standard constructor ==
{{{SQLiteDataProvider(string server, string database, string username, string password);}}}

This is a default constructor. It works, but only the "database" is used.

== XML node ==
{{{public SQLiteDataProvider(XmlNode node);}}}

Constructs a SQLiteDataprovider with an XmlNode as a parameter. The node has to have either an attribute "connectionString", containing the complete connection string, or an attribute "database", with a path to a database file. 

{{{
<!-- This is an XML node in the app's configuration file -->
<dataprovider 
      type="Glue.Data.Providers.SQLite.SQLiteDataProvider" 
      database="App_Data/databasefile.db3"
/>
}}}
