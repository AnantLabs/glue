# What is Glue? #

Glue is a simple framework for creating clean, elegant applications on
.NET or mono.

Glue consists of a number of libraries to provide you with the basic
infrastructure for your application: logging, configuration, plus sane and
simple data access.

For web applications, you can either go the ASP.NET way or choose
Glue-Web to create a nice and easy web application the MVC
(model-view-controller) way.
