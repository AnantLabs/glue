== List ==
The List methods in the IDataProvider interface return lists of objects. They are generated from the rows returned by a SELECT query. The List methods take care of constructing the query itself

{{{

// Find the customers that joined in the last month.
Filter newFilter = new Filter("date > @0", DateTime.Now - 30);

List<Customer> newCustomers = provider.List<Customer>(newFilter, null, null);

}}}
